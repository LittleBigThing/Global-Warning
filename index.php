			<p>Global warming is the increase of Earth's average surface temperature due to greenhouse gases that collect in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) absorb heat that would otherwise escape from the Earth. No science-fiction, scientifically proved facts.</p>

					<h2>Climate Change</h2>
					<p>Global warming results in more extreme weather conditions. More natural disasters, like floods, earthquakes, ... are taking place. Temperatures are getting more extreme. Rain and snowfall are increasing across the globe, on average.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
					<p>Increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature and precipitation, like rain, have significant effects on plant growth. They can be harmful beyond the physiological limits of the plant. They affect plant distribution and their life cycle directly. Indirect effects are caused by interaction with other species.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Sea Level Rise</h2>
					<p>Ice sheets and glaciers are melting by the increasing surface temperature. The water from melting ice results in a rising sea level. Within the foreseeable future, the sea level could rise by 4 to 6 metres or more.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Diseases</h2>
					<p>Temperature rise can affect human health and diseases they are exposed to. With increasing rainfall, water borne diseases, like malaria, are likely to spread. Heat waves can also cause damage to young and old people.</p>
