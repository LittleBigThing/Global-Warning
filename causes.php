			<p>Global warming is <a href="http://www.climatehotmap.org/about/global-warming-causes.html">primarily a problem</a> of too much greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They act as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. Greenhouse gases are produced by several human activities. The economic sectors that contribute siginificantly to these emissions are energy supply, industry, forestry, agriculture and transport.</p>

					<h2>Fossil Fuels</h2>
					<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is captured by organisms, like plants, using sunlight. Remains of these organims can transform into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel">fossil fuels</a> over a <strong>long period of time</strong>. They contain high percentages of carbon, including petroleum, coal and natural gas. Burning them to generate warmth and energy produces CO<sub>2</sub>. They are <em>not</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy">renewable source of energy</a> since we use them quicker than they can be formed.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Agricultural practices</h2>
					<p>Earth&rsquo;s population is <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">growing rapidly</a>. In our growning need for food, agricultural practices aggravate the problem of global warming. The effect arise from manufacture and use of pesticides and fertilizers, fuel and oil for tractors, equipment, transportation, electricity for lighting, cooling, and heating, and emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, nitrous oxide and other greenhouse gases.</p>

				<div>
					<h2>Cutting down and burning forests</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/climate-change/">(Rain)forests</a> are being destroyed to create pastures and plantations for agricultural purpose or to build houses. This leads to a net loss of areas that can capture CO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, animals lose their natural habitat and biodiversity suffers.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Waste management</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/climate-change-waste/">disposal and treatment of waste</a> can produce emissions of several greenhouse gases. Waste prevention and recycling help address global climate change by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and saving energy.</p>
